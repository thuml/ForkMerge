## Updates

#### 2023.11

We are working to organize the code and will release the complete codebase later! 
Currently, we provide the implementation of ForkMerge in [auxiliary domain image recognition](./auxiliary_domain_image_recognition) scenario. 
Please refer to [auxiliary_domain_image_recognition/README.md](./auxiliary_domain_image_recognition/README.md) for details.

**There might be some bugs in code of this develop branch. 
After we double-check the code and make sure to reproduce our results, we will merge it into the master branch.**
